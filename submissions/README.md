# RISC-V Simulator

This project is a modular RISC-V simulator designed to explore various performance-enhancing features such as instruction prefetching, branch prediction, operand forwarding, and more. It supports incremental upgrades from a basic in-order simulator to an advanced out-of-order simulation engine.
